    "Bajaj Pulsar N250 is a street bike available at a starting price of Rs. 1,44,285 in India. It is available in 2 variants and 4 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 1,50,429. The Bajaj Pulsar N250 is powered by 249cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 24.1 bhp and a torque of 21.5 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Bajaj Pulsar N250 comes up with anti-locking braking system. This Pulsar N250 bike weighs 162 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 14 liters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bajaj has kick-started a new era of its iconic Pulsar family with the launch of the new 250cc siblings. Out of the two variants of the bike, the Pulsar N250 is the naked version with a minimalistic yet aggressive front section with a single-piece handlebar. The semi-faired F trim, meanwhile, gets a bulky front cowl with clip-ons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pulsar N250 retains some styling cues of the NS200 but in a fresh avatar. The most distinctive aspect is the front fascia which comprises an LED projector flanked by eyebrow-like slim LED DRLs. The edginess and aggression continue at the back with sharp fuel tank extensions and a sleek and raked tail section. As for the features, thereâ€™s an assist and slipper clutch for easy and safe gearshifts along with a new semi-digital console. You also get a USB charging port sitting under the handlebar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 250cc, oil-cooled motor of the new Pulsar is the largest engine we have ever seen in this family. The company says this is a free-revving mill and offers a meaty mid-range performance. As for the numbers, it pumps out 24.1bhp of power and 21.5Nm of torque. It comes mated to a five-speed gearbox. It rides on 17-inch alloy wheels shod with 100/80 and 130/70 section tyres at the front and rear, respectively. Handling damping duties is are 37mm telescopic forks and a monoshock while the braking setup comprises a single disc at both ends. The fuel tank capacity is quite impressive at 14-litre.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motorcycle has been introduced only in a grey paint scheme as of now. In India, the motorcycle will go up against the likes of the Suzuki Gixxer 250 and the Yamaha FZ25.\n",
